# About Me <3
I’m from Dallas, Texas, and have a background in sales. After years in the insurance industry, I decided to start a small business. While putting together the business, I began to wish I had kept up with the coding skills I gained in high school to make the website process easier. I decided to apply to Techtonica because it was an answer to prayers during a time I really wanted to change my career with no understanding of how to get into the tech industry. I looked into Techtonica after it was recommended to me, and I knew they would be able to help prepare me for the tech industry.
